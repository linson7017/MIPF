/*
  class RopeSimulation is derived from class Simulation (see Physics1.h). It simulates a rope with 
  point-like particles binded with springs. The springs have inner friction and normal length. One tip of 
  the rope is stabilized at a point in space called "Vector3F ropeConnectionPos". This point can be 
  moved externally by a method "void setRopeConnectionVel(Vector3F ropeConnectionVel)". RopeSimulation 
  creates air friction and a planer surface (or ground) with a normal in +y direction. RopeSimulation 
  implements the force applied by this surface. In the code, the surface is refered as "ground".
